#notes 
- async gameplay(stateless)

- Matches are played asynchronously
This means that both players do not have to be playing at the same time. If player 1 plays "Rock", and player 2 plays "Paper" a day later, everything should be ok.
Google asynchronous gameplay definition

-Matches are first to 3 wins

-Each game will show a history of the current match
Example: In game 3, the players will be able to see the picks and results of games 1 and 2.

-Users sign in with a username and password

-Users can also sign up if the username does not exist

-You will need to implement sessions (see next point).

-When a user signs in, they should be able to start a game with another player by username

-When a user signs in, they should be able to see all their current games

-Clicking on a game should take the user to that game's show page

-On a game's show page, the user should be able to see the current status of the game
This includes who has/hasn't played the current round, as well as a move history of the game

-On a game's show page, a user should be able to make a move (if they have not made a move for that round already)
